# (t)he (F)ree (L)inux (I)nitiative

But linux is already free, you say!
As the basis of most operating systems on devices in the world and arguably most successful free software project in history, it might seem strange to suggest that linux still needs an initiative advocating for its freedom.
Yet [freedom is a complicated affair](https://www.iwm.at/publication/iwmpost-article/is-it-stupid-to-think-information-wants-to-be-free).
If we are to plumb the real philosophical stakes of that term, we begin to distinguish its nuances: is linux free as in beer, or free as in speech?
The GNU project acknowledges the complicated nature of free software's definition in a [cyclical definition](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html): "'Free software' means software that respects users' freedom and community."
To be free software means software that allow users to be free.

The Free Linux Intiative (tFLI) is an intiative to keep linux free and to make it more free.
Software needs maintenance, and we need to respect the fact of its laborious construction.
If we rely on the good will of open source maintainers without deeper thinking about creating resilient institutions for their work, we implicitly defer control to the monied entities that subsidize their labor.
Thus tFLI is committed to thinking critically about how to keep software like linux free; legally, politically and institutionally.

Our charter at tFLI consists of three primary purposes:

1. Prototype software and hardware systems that realize linux's freedom [[LEMMA](./lemma/readme.md)].
2. Publish critical, historical, and philosophical research on software freedom [[1](https://www.ohrg.org/deconstructing-urbit), [2](https://www.iwm.at/publication/iwmpost-article/is-it-stupid-to-think-information-wants-to-be-free)].
3. Educate and develop pedagogy for critical software practice [[1](https://cs-for-social-change.ohrg.org/), [2](https://cceai.ohrg.org/)].
