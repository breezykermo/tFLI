# (t)he (F)ree (L)inux (I)nitiative

But linux is already free, you say!
As the basis of most operating systems on devices in the world and arguably most successful free software project in history, it might seem strange to suggest that linux still needs an initiative advocating for its freedom.
Yet [freedom is a complicated affair](https://www.iwm.at/publication/iwmpost-article/is-it-stupid-to-think-information-wants-to-be-free).
If we are to plumb the real philosophical stakes of that term, we begin to distinguish its nuances: is linux [[https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/585xeu/why_the_expression_free_as_in_beer_beer_is_not/][free as in beer]], free as in speech, or [[https://opensource.com/article/17/2/hidden-costs-free-software][free as in puppies]]?
The nature of freedom in free software is no simple matter, as the GNU project's [cyclical definition](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html) of it acknowledges: "'Free software' means software that respects users' freedom and community."
Free software, apparently, means the kind of software that allow users to be free.

The Free Linux Intiative (tFLI) is an intiative to keep software like linux free, and to work to make it more free.
Software needs maintenance, and we need to respect the fact of its laborious construction.
If we rely on the good will of open source maintainers without deeper thinking about creating resilient institutions for their work, we implicitly defer control to the monied entities that subsidize their labor.
Thus tFLI is committed to thinking critically about how to keep software like linux free; practically, institutionally, legally, and politically.

Our charter at tFLI consists of three primary purposes:

1. Prototype software and hardware systems that realize linux's freedom [[LEMMA](./lemma/readme.md)].
2. Publish critical, historical, and philosophical research on software freedom [[1](https://www.ohrg.org/deconstructing-urbit), [2](https://www.iwm.at/publication/iwmpost-article/is-it-stupid-to-think-information-wants-to-be-free)].
3. Educate and develop pedagogy for critical software practice [[1](https://cs-for-social-change.ohrg.org/), [2](https://cceai.ohrg.org/)].
